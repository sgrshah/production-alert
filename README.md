# production-alert
Alerts developers when they are on production site and not development.

I have initialized this to work with vhx.tv projects. However, feel free to fork and change manifest.json to any matcher you'd like. See [this](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns) to create matchers.

In order to run this on chrome, just follow the load the extension instructions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).
